                    be limited to the amount actually paid by You through the Service or 100 USD if You haven't

                    To the maximum extent permitted by applicable law, in no event shall the Company or its suppliers be
                    liable for any special, incidental, indirect, or consequential damages whatsoever (including, but
                    not limited to, damages for loss of profits, loss of data or other information, for business
                    interruption, for personal injury, loss of privacy arising out of or in any way related to the use

                    Some states do not allow the exclusion of implied warranties or limitation of liability for
                    incidental or consequential damages, which means that some of the above limitations may not apply.
                    In these states, each party's liability will be limited to the greatest extent permitted by law.
